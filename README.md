Background

The clothing delivery system (GoOutfit) is a web-based application system that is designed
to provide a centralized platform for customers to buy authentic clothing from their
favorite brands as well as from individual sellers who sell authentic clothing from different
brands, and to help individuals start their business with ease by using our platform instead
of promoting their products through other platforms such as social media.
Technique which GoOutfit supports is the development of a clothing delivery system as an
alternative platform for local sellers, as well as famous brands, and buyers. By offering a
platform that facilitates commerce between customers and aids users in increasing sales
growth and customer retention by selling items on our platform, we will build an application
that focuses on the customer to customer business model.


GoOutfit System Architecture

Figure 1: System Overview
This system (GoOutfit web application) is going to be developed in order to be used by the
users who are interested in buying and selling clothes using an automated web based
online platform and via an online cloth delivery application. Basically, this system has
Two different types of users, customer and admin. where one is the customer and another
is the local seller or a banded cloth retailer. This system can be used in different types of
environments, users can use this system from anywhere running browsers by using any
handheld device such as mobile, tablet or computer. The system offers a web user
interface which allows users to interact with the functions and services through a web
browser. The main functions of this system are classified into 3 modules which are Order
system, management(user account) and dashboard module. In the Order system
module, it has six functions which are registration and login, add product to the cart, view
product, checkout and make payment. In order to use this system, users (customers/ local
sellers) need to register themselves and then can access the other functions or services
filling up the required data of login. The account management module consists of two
functions, which are to edit customer accounts, delete customer accounts. These
functions allow users to add, edit, delete and update their account and a function to notify
users. The last module is the dashboard management module whose function is for the
admin.In this section admin can CRUD store, CRUD product, CRUD manufacturer, CRUD
product management, CRUD coupon, view customer accounts and manage orders.
